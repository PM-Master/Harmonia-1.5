Policy Machine 1.5

NIST

General Information:
The Policy Machine is an access control mechanism that comprises: (1) Access control data used to express access control policies and deliver capabilities of data services to perform operations on objects; (2) a set of administrative operations for configuring the access control; and (3) a set of functions for enforcing policy on requests to execute operations on objects and for computing access decisions to accommodate or reject those requests based on the current state of the access control data.
What distinguish the Policy Machine from other mechanisms are the data elements and relations that define its access control data, the type of operations that are recognized, and the functions that it implements. These specifics are driven by a redefinition of access control and data services in terms of what is believed to be their common and underlying elements, relations, and functions.
